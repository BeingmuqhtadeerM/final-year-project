# Stroke Identification Using Deep Learning

## Overview

This project implements a deep learning-based system for the identification and prediction of strokes. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals or automated systems in detecting the risk of stroke in patients based on medical data, enabling earlier intervention and potentially saving lives.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for medical datasets.
- Deep learning model (e.g., CNN, RNN, or MLP) for stroke prediction.
- Model training, validation, and testing scripts.
- Performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- (Optional) GUI or command-line interface for user-friendly predictions.

---

## Dataset

- The model is trained on a stroke dataset (e.g., Kaggle Stroke Prediction Dataset or another public/private dataset).
- Typical features include age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking status, etc.
- **Note:** Ensure compliance with data privacy and licensing terms.

## Deep Learning Approach

- The project uses a deep learning architecture (please specify: e.g., Multi-Layer Perceptron, Convolutional Neural Network, etc.).
- Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch (please specify which one).
- Data split into training, validation, and test sets.
- Model evaluation with standard classification metrics.
